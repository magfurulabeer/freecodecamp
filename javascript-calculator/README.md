# javascript-calculator
An iOS Calculator clone I did for The Odin Project and Free Code Camp.
This project is identical to the project found in the_odin_project repository.

## Features:
* Can do basic math operations and can chain operations
* Operational percent,decimal, and toggle-negative buttons
* Outputs that are too long for the screen have font sizes automatically
adjusted to fit
* Easter Egg: Pressing the home button will display a random message on the screen
* Easter Egg: Pressing the home button while certain numbers are on the screen will display corresponding message on the screen (e.g. 3.14 => "Happy Halloween")

## Zipline: Build A Javascript Calculator
* Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that successfully reverse-engineers this: http://codepen.io/GeoffStorbeck/full/zxgaqw.
* Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code on CodePen. Figure it out for yourself.
* Rule #2: You may use whichever libraries or APIs you need.
* Rule #3: Reverse engineer the example project's functionality, and also feel free to personalize it.
* Here are the user stories you must enable, and optional bonus user stories:
* User Story: As a user, I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
* Bonus User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
* Bonus User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
